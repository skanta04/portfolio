            <p>My name is Shreeya, a second-year undergraduate at UNC Chapel Hill purusing towards a B.S. in Computer Science and a double minor in Statistics and Media and Journalism. My general interests revolve around web and app devlopment. I am interested in exploring the overlap between web development and machine learning and learning more about text & data-mining. I am currently the president and founder of my school's sorority for females interested in computer science and engineering fields. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, watching movies, and meeting new people.</p>
